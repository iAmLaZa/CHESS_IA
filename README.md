# CHESS_IA
Utilizing computer vision techniques and convolutional neural networks (CNN), the algorithms created for this project classify chess pieces and identify their location on a chessboard. The final application saves images throughout to visualize the performance and outputs a 2D image of the chessboard to see the result USING PYTHON AND OPEN CV
